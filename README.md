<p>I'm Kimberly, Kim for short - not Kim Possible but I like proving to self that I can make the impossible, possible.</p>
<p>Currently enjoying my time as a software engineer <b>@GitHub</b> <img width=50 height=45 src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17414922/228688837-87fcd8d7-3f75-4276-9e35-f08dec308283.gif" />

<p>Sometimes I help my mom with her 🧁 bakery business by decorating sugar cookies. Check us out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sprinklesomething/">@sprinklesomething</a></p>
<p>I spend most of my free time gaming. Let's chat about ♥️ Kingdom Hearts or the 🐉 Yakuza series</p>
<p>My current hobby is 🧶 crocheting things like tops, amigurumi, and accessories (I made the bottle holder shown in my GH avatar!)</p>
<p>I am a 🌱 nature enthusiast - I am no plant expert but I enjoy gardening and taking care of my house plants</p>
